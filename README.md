## Description

Insert HTML widgets in the head or body of your Nova app.

In some cases, you may need to add a floating chat from Zendesk, tracking codes from Google Analytics, DDoS protection from Cloudflare, etc., to your app. This package will help you manage these easily!

## Installation

[![Latest Version on Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/opscale-co/nova-widgets.svg?style=flat-square)](https://packagist.org/packages/opscale-co/nova-widgets)

You can install the package in to a Laravel app that uses [Nova](https://nova.laravel.com) via composer:

```bash

composer require opscale-co/nova-widgets

Next up, you must register the tool with Nova. This is typically done in the `tools` method of the `NovaServiceProvider`.

```php

// in app/Providers/NovaServiceProvider.php
// ...
public function tools()
{
    return [
        // ...
        new \Opscale\NovaWidgets\Tool(),
    ];
}

```

## Usage

You will see a “Widgets” item in your menu by default. You can add new widgets using this CRUD.
